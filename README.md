## Introduction  

This project applies **K-Means clustering** to the **Mall Customers dataset** in order to segment customers based on **age, income, and spending score**.  
By identifying distinct customer groups, businesses can design **targeted marketing strategies**, improve customer experience, and optimize resource allocation.  
We also use the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters and visualize the results for better interpretation.

### Customer Personas Overview

We translated each cluster into a clear customer persona to support targeted marketing and product strategies.

| Cluster | Persona Name             | Description |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 0       | **Conservative Elders**  | Older customers with moderate income and spending. Likely to be loyal but price-conscious. May respond to trust-based and loyalty programs. |
| 1       | **Premium Spenders**     | High-income, mid-aged individuals with high spending scores. Ideal audience for luxury goods, premium subscriptions, and personalized experiences. |
| 2       | **Young Impulsive Buyers** | Very young customers with low income but high spending. Likely responsive to trends, social media ads, and discounts. |
| 3       | **Frugal Millennials**   | Young adults with mid-level income and cautious spending. May prefer budget brands, practical goods, or value-based offers. |
| 4       | **Wealthy Minimalists**  | Older, high-income individuals with minimal spending. Possibly value simplicity, sustainability, or high-end essentials over frequent purchases. |

### Business Recommendations

- **Target Clusters 1 and 2** with personalized marketing, exclusive bundles, and loyalty programs.
- **Explore re-engagement strategies** for Cluster 4, such as premium services or curated, minimalist experiences.
- **Consider discounts and practical product campaigns** for Cluster 3, focusing on utility and value.
- **Cluster 0** could be engaged through trust-based communication, senior-friendly UI/UX, and long-term service offerings.

These personas enable better targeting, positioning, and prioritization of business strategies.
